# Raspberry-Python-Program-
This is the python program I created for my final year Engineering project using a Raspberry pi controller.
The main Objectives of this Program are as below :
1. Controlling  Relay switch based on the inputs of the Infrared Sensor. 
2. Scanning a QR code using the Pi camera and Zbar module.
3. Writing the collected details to a MySQL Database

This was the first program I wrote using python. Its a program made by joining snipet codes for each Objective I learnt by searching online.

The program is used to drive the whole process for my project. The Working of the project is as follows:

            -Design of an Automated system to detect tin cans put inside the Machine.
            
            -After detection, Crush the can using a pnuematic cyclinder as a crusher by switching ON a Relay.
            
            -Wait for the user to see if more cans are disposed.
            
            -Count total number of cans. 
            
            -Scan QR code shown by the User and collect user id from it.
            
            -Store the value of the count in the User's id in a Database if the id exists or create new row for the user id  store the value.
