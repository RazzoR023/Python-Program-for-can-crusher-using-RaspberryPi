# Raspberry-Python-Program-
This is the python program I created for my final year Engineering project using a Raspberry pi controller.
The main Objectives of this Program are as below :
1. Controlling a Relay switchs based on the inputs of the user. 
2. Scanning a QR code using the Pi camera and Zbar module.
3. Writing the collected details to a MySQL Database

This was the first program I wrote using python. Its a program made by joining snipet codes for each Objective I learnt by searching online.
